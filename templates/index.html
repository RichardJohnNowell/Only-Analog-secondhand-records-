        Only Analog (OA) is a secondhand records and cassettes stall in St. Nicholas Market, Bristol BS1.
        The title Only Analog comes from the policy of selling music that is an analog format rather than
        digital, such as cds. The logo 'Smooth not brittle' reflects how the music sounds - analog is
        smooth while digital is brittle. The idea for Only Analog came about when talking to djs
        and music lovers about how they preferred the smoothness, or continuity, of the sound.
        The website page 'Opinions' explores these ideas; the pros and cons of each format.

        <p>
        Many of our records and cassettes are reasonably priced and kept up-to-date
        with bigger enterprises available online. OA do keep rarer products for sale,
        which are available to reserve using our free members database. Some are
        expensive but reflect the current market; records are collectables but also still
        used by professionals. OA would like to sell more up-to-date cassettes, but
        the amount is limited by the fact that very few people have cassette players!
