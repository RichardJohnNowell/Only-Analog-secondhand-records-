             cassettes stall in St. Nicholas Market, Bristol BS1. The title Only Analog comes from our policy of selling 
             music that is an analog format rather than digital, such as cds. Our logo 'Smooth not brittle' reflects how 
             the music sounds - analog is smooth while digital is brittle. The original idea for Only Analog came about 
             when talking to djs and music lovers about how they preferred the smoothness, or continuity, of the sound. 
             The website page 'Opinions' explores these ideas; the pros and cons of each format.
