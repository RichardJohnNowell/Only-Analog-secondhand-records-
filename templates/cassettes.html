                  Many of our records and cassettes are reasonably priced and kept up-to-date
                  with bigger enterprises available online. OA do keep rarer products for sale,
                  which are available to reserve using our free members database. Some are
                  expensive but reflect the current market; records are collectables but also still
                  used by professionals. OA would like to sell more up-to-date cassettes, but
                  the amount is limited by the fact that very few people have cassette players!
