## Introduction

The idea of the Only Analog stall was inspired by various existing stalls in 
the indoor St. Nicholas market in Bristol. These three stalls and two local shops
provide a wide selection of secondhand records and some cassettes. Many of the images 
on this website were taken by me at those shops with the cooperation of the owners 
who all expressed an interest in the project.

The background to this re-emergence of my liking for the anlogue sound was started 
by finding a once-valuable cassette deck in another, less fancy market building,
known simply as 'The Stokes Croft Indoor Market'. I knew a friend who had a huge 
cassette collection and knowing he'd buy a secondhand machine, I paid the Â£20 and 
took home the player, which was filthy. 

Cleaning the body and the heads with Dettol wet-wipes, a lovely machine emerged.
I then presented it to him and he has not stopped using it since. It was noticeable 
that when compared to cds he had, the sound of the cassettes, for all its faults, 
was so much smoother - voices became lush rather than exact algorithmic products.
This is the origin of OA's logo 'Smooth not brittle': digital music sounds brittle.

While there is a limited interest in records and less so in cassettes, market research 
suggests people and professionals interested in the media tend to pay good money for what 
they want. The three stalls and two shops which have kindly participated, have existed in 
various forms for decades and each has a vast stock of the media. There is money to be made!

## Testing

## Deployment

The website Only Analog Records was deployed using Render.com around 10am on 27th July 2023. I used Render as it has a free tier for its smaller websites and connects internally to a new PostgreSQL database, thus minimising linkage hassles between the site and the database. Render built the site within a a couple of minutes using the GitHub repo. The first few tries at deployment, as it was not a process I knew much about, failed mainly through choosing the wrong type of site (it is now part of their webservices category) and a struggle to get versions of the modules needed that Render insisted on. I then had to change the python file run.py to app.py, but it has now succeeded and the website is up-and-running. I considered using Heroku, but apart from its authentification regime, the amazing sites fellow students have put together now no longer work because of Heroku's 12 month limit. Migration from Heroku is not easy, so my choice was to use Render.com from the beginning.
