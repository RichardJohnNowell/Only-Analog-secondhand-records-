## Introduction

The idea of the Only Analog stall was inspired by various existing stalls in 
the indoor St. Nicholas market in Bristol. These three stalls and two local shops
provide a wide selection of secondhand records and some cassettes. Many of the images 
on this website were taken by me at those shops with the cooperation of the owners 
who all expressed an interest in the project.

The background to this re-emergence of my liking for the anlogue sound was started 
by finding a once-valuable cassette deck in another, less fancy market building,
known simply as 'The Stokes Croft Indoor Market'. I knew a friend who had a huge 
cassette collection and knowing he'd buy a secondhand machine, I paid the Â£20 and 
took home the player, which was filthy. 

Cleaning the body and the heads with Dettol wet-wipes, a lovely machine emerged.
I then presented it to him and he has not stopped using it since. It was noticeable 
that when compared to cds he had, the sound of the cassettes, for all its faults, 
was so much smoother - voices became lush rather than exact algorithmic products.
This is the origin of OA's logo 'Smooth not brittle': digital music sounds brittle.

While there is a limited interest in records and less so in cassettes, market research 
suggests people and professionals interested in the media tend to pay good money for what 
they want. The three stalls and two shops which have kindly participated, have existed in 
various forms for decades and each has a vast stock of the media. There is money to be made!

## Expectations


## User Experience

User Experience and customer expectations:
i) When a user visits the site, they will find it easily navigable.
ii) Information can be clearly seen by people with limited sight options.
iii) Membership can be obtained free-of-charge (with conditions).
iv) Membership allows a user to reserve any products they wish to buy (max. 5 items 10 days).
v) Contacting OA is easily done with a professional form.
vi) A Blog contains item of interest and possible hints to buy...

viii) The site has images that can show different media.
ix) Only Analog is shown to be a reputable business with a history.
x) Some information about the market itself.

The colour scheme used was inspired by the website "Looka.com" and their blog article
on the top logo colour trends for 2023. It's easy to opt for, say, Bootstrap's
default colours, but having something more up-to-date seemed a resonable move.
I chose a 'zesty' Orange #F5793B as it is popular at the moment and is different from
red or blue etc. Then using encycolorpedia.com/#f5793b, I chose
colours that were complimentary or seemed attractive. This approach gave
me a poool of colours to work from.

The font Nunito Sans is a modern, plain and readable font that is sixth
in the "justcreative.com/best-google-fonts for professional
designers". Quoting: "Projecting professional confidence, this font can 
make words hold integrity and depth."

<!--- comment --->

A user can login or register. They can then go to the record or cassettte
database where they can reserve up to 5 items for 10 days.

The user needs assurances that passwords are well protectyed.
The user needs o know that they have reserved items.
Objects cannot be bought online - no ecommerce (as with the stalls and shops visited).

VAT is not included - business users might wish this (they can get VAT)???????????
