<p>The website for Only Analog records and cassettes.</p>
<br>
<p>Only Analog is a well-known store in St.Nicholas market, Bristol. We sell only records and cassettes, preferring the sound of analog formats.</p>

The idea of the Only Analog stall was inspired by various existing stalls in 
the indoor St. Nicholas market in Bristol. 

These three stalls and two local shops
provide a wide selection of secondhand records and some cassettes.

Many of the images on this website were taken by me at those shops 
with the cooperation of the owners who all expressed an interest in
the project.

A re-emergence of my liking for the anlogue sound was started by finding
a once-valuable cassette deck in another, less fancy market building,
known simply as 'The Stokes Croft Indoor Market'. 

I knew a friend who had a huge cassette collection and knowing he'd buy 
a secondhand machine, I paid the Â£20 and took home the player, which was filthy. 

Cleaning it and the heads with Dettol wet-wipes, a lovely machine emerged.

I then presented it to him and he has not stopped using it since.

It was noticeable that when compared to cds he had, the sound of the
cassettes, for all its faults, was so much smoother - voices became 
lush rather than exact algorithmic products.

This is the origin of OA's logo 'Smooth not brittle': digital
music sounds brittle.

While there is a limited interest in records and less so in cassettes,
market research suggests people interested in the media tend to pay good 
money for what they want.

The three stalls and two shops have existed in various forms for decades
and each has a vast stock of the media.

There is money to be made!

Links to the vendors' websites can be found in the credits section.

A user can login or register. They can then go to the record or cassettte
database where they can reserve up to 5 items for 10 days.

The user needs assurances that passwords are well protectyed.
The user needs o know that they have reserved items.
Objects cannot be bought online - no ecommerce (as with the stalls and shops visited).

VAT is not included - business users might wish this (they can get VAT)???????????
